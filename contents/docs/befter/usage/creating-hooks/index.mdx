## Introduction

Befter is a simple and effective JavaScript library for managing hooks in your applications. It provides a way to add hooks to specific labels and manage them efficiently, allowing you to execute, update, and remove hooks dynamically. Befter also supports `before` and `after` hooks, enabling more complex workflows.

## Core APIs and Usage

### 1. `createBefter()`

#### Definition

The `createBefter` function is used to create a new hook manager. It returns an object that can hold various hooks associated with labels.

#### Usage

```javascript
const hooks = createBefter();
```

- **Arguments**: None.
- **Returns**: An object representing the hook manager.

#### Real-World Example

In a larger application, you would call `createBefter()` to initialize your hook manager:

```javascript
// Initialize the hook manager
const hooks = createBefter();
```

---

### 2. `hook(hooks, label, fn)`

#### Definition

The `hook` function allows you to associate a hook function with a specific label. This function will be stored in the hook manager, and you can call it later.

#### Usage

```javascript
const { currHook, removeHook } = hook(hooks, 'hook1', () => console.log('This is a hook'));
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): A label to associate with the hook.
  - `fn` (Function): The function to be executed when the hook is called.

- **Returns**: An object containing:
  - `currHook`: The current list of functions for the specified label.
  - `removeHook`: A function used to remove a specific hook.

#### Real-World Example

Imagine you need to handle form submission and want to execute hooks before and after the form is submitted:

```javascript
const hooks = createBefter();

// Add a hook for form submission
hook(hooks, 'formSubmit', () => console.log('Form submitted!'));
```

---

### 3. `callHook(hooks, label)`

#### Definition

The `callHook` function triggers all the hooks associated with a specific label.

#### Usage

```javascript
callHook(hooks, 'hook1');
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be called.

- **Returns**: None.

#### Real-World Example

After adding the `formSubmit` hook, you can call it like this:

```javascript
// Call the formSubmit hook
callHook(hooks, 'formSubmit');
```

This will log `"Form submitted!"` in the console.

---

### 4. `updateHook(hooks, label, hookFunction, newFn)`

#### Definition

The `updateHook` function is used to replace an existing hook function associated with a label. You can update the function at a specific index in the list.

#### Usage

```javascript
updateHook(hooks, 'hook1', currHook['hook1'][0], () => console.log('Updated hook'));
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be updated.
  - `hookFunction` (Function): The existing hook function to be replaced.
  - `newFn` (Function): The new function to replace the old one.

- **Returns**: None.

#### Real-World Example

In the case of a login process, you might want to update the `login` hook when the logic changes:

```javascript
const hooks = createBefter();

// Add initial login hook
let { currHook } = hook(hooks, 'login', () => console.log('Logging in...'));

// Call the initial hook
callHook(hooks, 'login');

// Update the login hook with new functionality
updateHook(hooks, 'login', currHook['login'][0], () => console.log('Logging in with new logic...'));

// Call the updated hook
callHook(hooks, 'login');
```

---

### 5. `removeHook(hooks, label, hookFunction)`

#### Definition

The `removeHook` function removes a specific hook from a given label. You must specify which function to remove.

#### Usage

```javascript
removeHook(hooks, 'hook1', hook1[0]);
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be removed.
  - `hookFunction` (Function): The hook function to be removed.

- **Returns**: The removed function.

#### Real-World Example

You may want to remove a specific hook after it has been executed:

```javascript
// Add a hook
const { currHook, removeHook } = hook(hooks, 'hook1', () => console.log('This is a hook'));

// Call the hook
callHook(hooks, 'hook1');

// Remove the hook after calling it
removeHook(hooks, 'hook1', currHook['hook1'][0]);
```

This will remove the first hook of `hook1` and prevent it from being called again.

---

### 6. `removeHookItSelf(hooks, label)`

#### Definition

The `removeHookItSelf` function removes all hooks associated with the given label.

#### Usage

```javascript
removeHookItSelf(hooks, 'hook1');
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be removed.

- **Returns**: The updated hook manager object.

#### Real-World Example

In a scenario where a hook should only run once, you can remove it after execution:

```javascript
// Add a hook for logging in
hook(hooks, 'login', () => console.log('Logging in...'));

// Call the hook
callHook(hooks, 'login');

// Remove the hook after it is called
removeHookItSelf(hooks, 'login');
```

---

### 7. `getHook(hooks, label)`

#### Definition

The `getHook` function retrieves the list of functions associated with a specific label.

#### Usage

```javascript
const hookList = getHook(hooks, 'hook1');
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to retrieve.

- **Returns**: An array of functions associated with the given label.

#### Real-World Example

You can use this function to get all hooks and perform some operations:

```javascript
const hooks = createBefter();

// Add some hooks
hook(hooks, 'beforeSave', () => console.log('Before saving'));
hook(hooks, 'afterSave', () => console.log('After saving'));

// Retrieve and call all hooks for 'beforeSave'
const beforeSaveHooks = getHook(hooks, 'beforeSave');
beforeSaveHooks.forEach(fn => fn());
```

---

### 8. `getHookWithIndex(hooks, label, index)`

#### Definition

The `getHookWithIndex` function retrieves a hook function from the list based on its index.

#### Usage

```javascript
const hookFunction = getHookWithIndex(hooks, 'hook1', 0);
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to retrieve.
  - `index` (Number): The index of the hook function to retrieve.

- **Returns**: The hook function at the specified index.

#### Real-World Example

You can retrieve a specific hook to update or replace it:

```javascript
// Add hooks for form validation
const { currHook } = hook(hooks, 'formValidate', () => console.log('Validating form'));

// Get the hook at index 0
const firstHook = getHookWithIndex(hooks, 'formValidate', 0);
console.log(firstHook);  // Function: () => console.log('Validating form')
```
