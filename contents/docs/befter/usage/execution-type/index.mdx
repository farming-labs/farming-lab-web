### `callHook(hooks, label, options)`

#### Definition

The `callHook` function triggers all the hooks associated with a specific label. It supports both serial and parallel execution modes, allowing for flexible hook management.

#### Usage

```javascript
await callHook(hooks, 'hook1');
await callHook(hooks, 'hook2', { runner: 'parallel' });
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object containing all registered hooks.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be called.
  - `options` (Object, Optional): Configuration for hook execution. Supported options:
    - `runner` (String): Execution mode, either `'serial'` (default) or `'parallel'`.

- **Returns**: None.

#### Real-World Example

After adding hooks like `hook1` and `hook2`, you can call them as follows:

```javascript
// Call hook1 in serial mode
await callHook(hooks, 'hook1');

// Call hook2 in parallel mode
await callHook(hooks, 'hook2', { runner: 'parallel' });
```

This will log the following in the console:

```
This is hook1
This is hook1
This is after hook1
This is hook2
This is after hook2
```

#### Execution Modes

- **Serial Mode**: Hooks are executed sequentially, one after the other. This is the default mode.
- **Parallel Mode**: Hooks are executed concurrently, which can improve performance for independent tasks.

#### Performance Comparison

The test example demonstrates the performance difference between serial and parallel execution:

```javascript
let startTime = performance.now();
await callHook(hooks, 'hook1'); // Serial execution
let endTime = performance.now();
const timeDiffOnSerial = endTime - startTime;

startTime = performance.now();
await callHook(hooks, 'hook2', { runner: 'parallel' }); // Parallel execution
endTime = performance.now();
const timeDiffOnParallel = endTime - startTime;

const totalDiffOnConfig = timeDiffOnSerial - timeDiffOnParallel;
expect(totalDiffOnConfig).greaterThan(0); // Parallel execution is faster
```

#### Expected Console Output

The following logs are expected when the hooks are called:

```
This is hook1
This is hook1
This is after hook1
This is hook2
This is after hook2
```

#### Notes

- Ensure that hooks are properly registered using the `hook` function before calling them.
- Use the `runner` option to control the execution mode based on your requirements.
- Parallel execution is faster for independent tasks but may require careful handling of shared resources.
