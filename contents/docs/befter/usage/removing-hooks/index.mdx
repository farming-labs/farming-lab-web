### Remove Hook


 `removeHook(hooks, label, hookFunction)`

#### Definition

The `removeHook` function removes a specific hook from a given label. You must specify which function to remove.

#### Usage

```javascript
removeHook(hooks, 'hook1', hook1[0]);
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be removed.
  - `hookFunction` (Function): The hook function to be removed.

- **Returns**: The removed function.

#### Real-World Example

You may want to remove a specific hook after it has been executed:

```javascript
// Add a hook
const { currHook, removeHook } = hook(hooks, 'hook1', () => console.log('This is a hook'));

// Call the hook
callHook(hooks, 'hook1');

// Remove the hook after calling it
removeHook(hooks, 'hook1', currHook['hook1'][0]);
```

This will remove the first hook of `hook1` and prevent it from being called again.


###  Remove Hook Itself


`removeHookItSelf(hooks, label)`

#### Definition

The `removeHookItSelf` function removes all hooks associated with the given label.

#### Usage

```javascript
removeHookItSelf(hooks, 'hook1');
```

- **Arguments**:
  - `hooks` (Object): The hook manager object.
  - `label` (String): The label of the hook to be removed.

- **Returns**: The updated hook manager object.

#### Real-World Example

In a scenario where a hook should only run once, you can remove it after execution:

```javascript
// Add a hook for logging in
hook(hooks, 'login', () => console.log('Logging in...'));

// Call the hook
callHook(hooks, 'login');

// Remove the hook after it is called
removeHookItSelf(hooks, 'login');
```
