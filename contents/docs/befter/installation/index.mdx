# Befter - Hook Management Library

`befter` is a lightweight library for managing hooks in JavaScript, allowing you to register, invoke, and manage hooks in a sequence. Here's how to install it and get started.

## Step 1: Install Befter via NPM

To install `befter`, you'll need to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager), which is typically installed along with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you haven't installed Node.js and npm yet, you can do so by downloading and installing the latest version of Node.js from their official website.

Once Node.js and npm are installed, run the following command in your project directory:
